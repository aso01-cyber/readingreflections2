        After reading through Laurel Schwulst’s writing centered around the documentation of ideas, and archives through digital means of communication: a website, I was able to gain a better understanding of how websites can act as many things, houses, plants, and even puddles. These natural concepts Schwult introduces to the viewers show how the language of code, now referenced as something alive, is all connected by a “river of knowledge,” suggesting that personal websites contribute to a shared flow of information. Even artists who mainly work with visualization and aesthetics can imagine alternatives to web structures. Things can be redefined and how it functions. 
        In this project, I aim to make a website that has the viewers come up close and observe the different themes and transitions, thinking about the viewer and interacting with the screen. I hope viewers will get up close to the screen to find and hover over different links and assets that (maybe) I can have animated. Since growing up, these early web spaces, which were usually “girly,” playful, and highly decorative, left a lasting impression on me. For my first website, I want to evoke the feeling of those games: nostalgic, visually dense, and slightly overwhelming in a way that brings up curiosity/hovering over different buttons or images. With this 'era' of the internet, I plan to recreate, I aim to make a personal web space that celebrates experimentation and the joys of youth.
