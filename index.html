        After reading through Laurel Schwulst’s writing centered around the documentation of ideas, and archives through digital means of communication: a website, I was able to gain a better understanding of how websites can act as many things, houses, plants, and even puddles. These natural concepts Schwult introduces to the viewers show how the language of code, now referenced as something alive, is all connected by a “river of knowledge,” suggesting that personal websites contribute to a shared flow of information. Even artists who mainly work with visualization and aesthetics can imagine alternatives to web structures. Things can be redefined and how it functions. 
        In this project, I aim to make a website that has the viewers come up close and observe the different themes and transitions, thinking about the viewer and interacting with the screen. I hope viewers will get up close to the screen to find and hover over different links and assets that (maybe) I can have animated. Since growing up, these early web spaces, which were usually “girly,” playful, and highly decorative, left a lasting impression on me. For my first website, I want to evoke the feeling of those games: nostalgic, visually dense, and slightly overwhelming in a way that brings up curiosity/hovering over different buttons or images. With this 'era' of the internet, I plan to recreate, I aim to make a personal web space that celebrates experimentation and the joys of youth.

    The early web, using “handmade web,” stands out for its quick connection, intertwined with links of all sorts. Similar to artists' books that emphasize care, labor, and individuality in a medium, web-based work can be seen as something imperfect without the option of undoing. What I found interesting while reading was how, in both cases, the value of the projects is not just in the final outcome, but in the visible traces of experimentation and personal decision-making. Instead of treating outdated aesthetics or broken functionality as failures, the author frames them as evidence of a living, temporal medium. Viewing old web pages today reveals them as living artifacts that can still work, with their technological history and traces of the past. Handmade websites lasting longer than physical artworks challenge ideas about what is to be permanent. The reading shows that digital spaces are not separate from art, but places where artists can experiment and express authorship. In a web now run by corporations and polished platforms, hand-coding and self-publishing become a freeing choice.

    Upon opening the reading, Hello World by Taeyoon Choi, I was introduced to a series of hand painted text using watercolor. The collaboration between traditional media along with the discussion of computer functions works well to establish the many narratives of the origin of computers, as it mentions how humans were actually the first computers. Not in the way that we were able to come up with all of these calculations and information on our own, but how life can’t be limited into “this” or “that,” and that in-between states exist as well. To connect the digital world and art, the article suggests that abstraction in computers can be compared to minimalist art, where more visual elements can be recognized given time. Certain computer design elements can mimic art forms in their shapes or organization which fuels repetition. I found it interesting how Taeyoon mentions how repetition is an important tool that helps us as we interact with structures that vary in complexity, scale, and design. We can further utilize these similarities or differences to help us recognize patterns and relate them back to make cities we want to live in. These shared patterns encourage people to think more critically about how systems are designed and how they might be reimagined to better support the ways people live and interact.
